Text Extraction Project
This project focuses on extracting valuable information from unstructured text data using techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The primary goal is to automate extracting key details from documents, images, and scanned files. By leveraging libraries like Tesseract for OCR and spaCy or NLTK for NLP, this project can handle tasks such as document parsing, keyword extraction, named entity recognition (NER), and text summarization. The system is designed to work with multiple formats, including PDFs, images, and text files, making it versatile and useful for a wide range of applications, including document management, data extraction for analysis, and even content extraction from online sources.
